Welcome to the GitHub page of the Malony open source project.

This is a project close to my heart, which I've spent a lot of time and passion building. After much thought, I've decided to make it open source. My aim is to contribute to the developer community by sharing my work, and I hope you'll find it useful.

**You can [add](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=956950572454514718&scope=bot&permissions=69005043736) the discord bot to your server!**
